        <h2>ABOUT</h2>
        <div class="experience">
            <p>Born in Germany and living in America since I was 4, I have grown a passion for programming. The wonderful inventions you could create with a computer brought me to study and improve myself as a software developer. Throughout my time in the field, I have utilized C#, HTML, CSS & SASS/SCSS, Bootstrap, Javascript & jQuery, PHP, SQL, and Python; In addition I plan to continue enhancing my skills to better complete whatever tasks I have at hand.</p>
            <section>
                <h4>> Education</h4>
                <p>My formal education for coding is thanks to "WeCan{Code}It" coding bootcamp, who's goal was to quickly prepare the basic training and skill asked for by companies. Over the course of six months, I was taught HTML5, css, bootstrap, JavsScript, JQuery, and basic database management.</p>

                <h4>> Employment</h4>
                <p>Before my enrollment in WeCan{Code}It I was working for 3 months under Stream9, where I was given illustrations by the lead designer and tasked with recreating the designs into a website. Afterwards, I have been currently working with Cleveland Hardware for around one and a half years, mainly for updating and maintaining their website. In addition to working there, I am working with <a href="https://bbginc.net/">Barrett Benefits Group (BBG)</a> to create an application which automatically fills out information from excel spreadsheets.</p>

                <p>My skills regarding front end development include HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap, SCSS, JavaScript, & JQuery. I also have experience with front-end design during my work at Cleveland Hardware.</p>

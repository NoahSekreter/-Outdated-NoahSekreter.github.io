        <h2>ABOUT</h2>
        <div class="experience">
            <p>Born in Germany and living in America since I was 4, I have grown a passion for programming. The wonderful inventions you could create with a computer brought me to study and improve myself as a software developer. Throughout my time in the field, I have utilized C#, HTML, CSS & SASS/SCSS, Bootstrap, Javascript & jQuery, PHP, SQL, and Python; I am always eager to learn new skills and enhance old skills for whatever tasks I have at hand.</p>
            <section>
                <h4>> Education</h4>
                <p>My formal education for coding is thanks to "WeCan{Code}It" coding bootcamp. Over the course of six months, I was taught HTML5, css, bootstrap, JavsScript, JQuery, back-end C# and basic SQL database management.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h4>> Employment</h4>
                <p>Before my enrollment at "WeCan{Code}It" I have worked at Stream9 for 3 months, a website development company in Cleveland. There I was tasked with recreating the designs of the lead designer into a website. After "WeCan{Code}It" I began working at Cleveland Hardware and Forging Company; during that time I redesigned the Cleveland Hardware website to give it a fresh new look and add mobile compatibility. I was contracted by Barrett Benefits Group (BBG) to develop software to auto-populate medical information onto Excel templates using Python.</p>

            <section>
                <h4>> Front-End</h4>
                <p>My skills regarding front end development include HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap, SCSS, JavaScript, & JQuery. I applied these front-end design skills during my work at Cleveland Hardware and Forging.</p>

            <section>
                <h4>> Back-End</h4>
                <p>For back-end programming, I have applied C# and PHP as well as integrating MySQL databases.</p>

            <section>
                <h4>> Software Development</h4>
                <p>I have independently taught myself Python and developed automation software to automate my account management tasks I had while working at BBG. Such features include Excel spreadsheet generation, Smartsheets integration, and medical quote retrieval via API.</p>

                    <p>I was hired by Cleveland Hardware to rework their website from the ground up. The main changes were to make the site feel more modern as well as add mobile compatibility. As of now, Cleveland Hardware has been dismantled as all operations have been moved to their parent company, Green Bay Drop forge.</p>

                    <p>At BBG, I have created software to fill out incomplete censuses containing employee health information. This software also fills out medical carrier templates using the completed censuses, greatly reducing data entry and streamline the workflow. In addition, CenFill comes equipped with Smartsheets integration and the ability to pull medical quotes through the CMS Marketplace API.</p>
